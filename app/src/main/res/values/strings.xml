        test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin
        in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each
        minute after you hear this signal. beep A single lap should be completed each time you hear
        this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second
        time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on
        the word start. On your mark, get ready, start. </string>
